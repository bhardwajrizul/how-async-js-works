# how-async-js-works

#### We know that JavaScript is a *Single Threaded* language with an *Event Loop*.

I tried to write same asynchronous code with the use of 
- `callbacks` The traditional method  
- `Promises` ES6 introduced promises using which we can make asynchronous calls and use `.then()` and  `.catch()` on the resolved or rejected the promise respectively. 
- `async-await` ES8 introduced `async` functions using witch we can resolve any promise using the `await` keyword.
